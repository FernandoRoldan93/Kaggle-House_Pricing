# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

### Description: 
We all know the platform [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it is a platform for Data Science and Machine Learning practitioners where you can find a lot competitions with or without price where people can practice and learn how to analyse and solve problems using a lot of different techniques. During my pass through the university i had to participate in one of this competitions. The main objetive of the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) competition is to predict sell prices for houses, but due to its easy data comprehension and small data size, it is a perfect start point for a lot of new data science and machine learning students, so it was perfect for the course.

In this repository I want to re-start the solution i did for that course in 2018, since it is not documented at all. Also the techniques I used are incomplete (for example, data visualization and exploratory analysis are missing). If you have any interest in that very first and incomplete aproach to the solution you can find it [here](./old_Solution/kaggle.py)  :skull:.

The new solution will, at least, cover the following points and it will be a python or R notebook (not decided yet):
- Exploratory analysis
- Data preprocesing
- Modelling
- Conclusion
